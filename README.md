Kinematic Equations Solver

Task: Write a program that solves for the final velocity, displacement, or time given the initial velocity, acceleration, and time. 
Implement the kinematic equations and validate the output with sample inputs.

Develop a library that incoorporates the necessary functions or classes to perform essential calculations required by users. 
Also submit a document file about the things you learned while doing the task( be it mathematics, logic or even code syntax ).
